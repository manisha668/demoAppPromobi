# demoAppPromobi
Demo app using jetpack components recommended by google for android app development in Kotlin

**NOTE** : Current implementation has the network call with retrofit 2 and storing data in room db using dagger 2 as DI,
Currently work is being done to handle the API response as the data is huge (usage of paging to handle data in recyclerview). Once done will be pushed to repo :).

Till then Happy coding to me and to you too
